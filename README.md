## Concept
A little cat is in a cup filled with coffee due to the cat’s nature of jumping around and destroying stuff. In this game it’s the opposite, where the cat cannot jump or destroy anything. And must make stuff in the café world to survive, the main food supply is coffee/tea for the cat.
The cat is a “cute” red housecat, in a white cup filled with black coffee. (the colors should be kept simple to avoid any mistakes in production).
World scene is a little café which leads out into a giant field filled with lots of flowers. Not the cat has to adapt to finding food and shelter in the wild. The player can choose to return or continue to drink coffee / tea.
Idea

The whole Idea is that cats can’t understand the human knowledge, or the human made devices, so that the game will continue the path to enlighten the player about cat behavior. It’s important to remember that cat behavior is not the same as “feline” behavior. Due to the lack of genes carried from the DNA. In the game you will after feeding the cat/dog and so on. The food it wants, getting to a point of no return. You will have to give up or continue with the choice you made in the game and be reminded of what you did to something by force. The point of the game would be a fun time killer for the “normal” gamer/player. Who wants a “cute” and fun game day, the game must be fun enough to stream and record videos in.? If not, the game will not become fun or immersive.

## Conclusion 

The game has to be more than 3 hr.+ long for the player, and the story has to be relatable in some way. It has to be understandable and bespoken, even though it’s a new game.
